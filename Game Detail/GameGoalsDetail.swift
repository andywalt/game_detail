                // I think this is for doing deletes or dragging to reorder in a list. I think this is causing problems with trying to get the edits to save.
//                EditButton()
                // Try just creating a simple bool.
                Button(action: {
                    self.model.showingEdit.toggle()
                }) {
                    Text("Edit")
                }
//            }
            if !self.model.showingEdit {
                Text(self.game.gameName ?? "No Game Name").font(.title)
                Text(self.game.gameDescription ?? "No Game Description").font(.subheadline)
                // Uncomment to experiment with switvhout out the navbar title when you change to edit mode
//                    .navigationBarTitle(Text(self.game.gameName ?? "No Game Name"), displayMode: .inline)
            } else {
                /* Almost! You are using Game (type) rather than game (instance of Game). If you change that to game you will be able to pass the specific type of Game. You would only use the Type inside of brackets like this when you're defining a function, and not when you're calling a function. When calling the function you provide the value/instance of the Type since the function already knows what Type to expect :)
                 
                 If using the View Model approach, i think the easiest way is to create the view model here and then pass along to the view right here too.
                 
                 So here we initialise an EditGameView, which requires a model parameter, so we in-line also initliase EditViewModel which takes a Game. You could write this out
                 
                 let model: EditViewModel = EditViewModel(game: self.game)
                 EditGameView(model: model)
                 
                 If you really wanted to.
                 */
                EditGameView(model: model) // View Model
//                EditGameView(game: game) // @State
                
                
//                    .onAppear {
//                        // I think this is where the onAppear goes but I'd imagine that I have to create a whole method like self.updatedGameInfo.gameName = self.game.gameName & a  self.updatedGameInfo = self.game.gameDescription
//                    }
//                    .onDisappear {
//                        // self.game.gameName = self.updatedGameInfo.gameName
//                    }
                
                /* onAppear and onDisappear would need to be used within EditGameView itself. I'm actually not sure what they would do here. They cause the view in which they exist to perform some action when the view that they are modifying appears or disappears.
                 
                 Put differently,imagine you have something like this where you want an alert to pop up when the label "Goose" scrolls onto the screen
                 
                 struct DuckDuckGoose: View {
                    var body: some View {
                        ScrollView {
                 
                            Text("Duck")
                            Text("Duck")
                            Text("Duck")
                            Text("Duck")
                            Text("Duck")
                            Text("Duck")
                            Text("Duck")
                            Text("Duck")
                            Text("Goose!")
                                .onAppear {
                                    showAlertFunction()
                                }
                 
                        }.font(.largeTitle)
                 
                    }
                 }
                 
                 
                 In this case, when Goose shows on screen in the view, the .onAppear modifier on the Text() item will trigger its closure. Likewise .onDisappear would trigger a closure when scrolling off the screen.
